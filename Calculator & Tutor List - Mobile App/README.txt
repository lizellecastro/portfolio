This application javascript code for a React Native mobile app is the most recent version of
the calculator app of a simple addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication calculator 
that outputs a result. This app includes another screen where the user can navigate to where
it has a scrollable list of "tutors". This app was a project done for my mobile application 
development course that challenged me in adding images, creating functional (and non-functional) 
buttons, navigating between screens, using the flat list component, and practicing applying the 
CSS box model. The images used for the 'tutors' are stock photos found online.
