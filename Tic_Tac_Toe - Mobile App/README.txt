This is a React Native mobile application created in javascript of a tic-tac-toe game. This app
allows the user to navigate between the Home, Play, Scoreboard, and Instructions screens. In the
Play screen is the tic-tac-toe game where the user can play against the computer. The user can
play for as many rounds as they want and once done they can move directly to the Scoreboard to view
final scores and includes an updated timestamp of completion. This project was created to challenge
my understanding in the use of stack navigation, inputing images, incorporating the flat list and
CSS box model, and developing an interactive, playable tic-tac-toe game.
