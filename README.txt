In this folder are the php files used to create a website on my AWS server 
through an EC2 instance by Ubuntu. It is a website that I practiced how to 
code in PHP that allows the user to enter a username and password that is 
already created in a mySQL database within the EC2 instance. Once entered,
the user will see a small to-do list that is information that was relayed from
the mySQL database and a sign out icon that allows the user to exit out of the
welcome page and back to the login page.
